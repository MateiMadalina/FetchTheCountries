# Fetch The Countries

## About Project

This project represents an interactive platform developed with the help of React.js and Express.js, where users can explore and interact with data about various countries from around the world. It was a significant learning experience for me as it was the first time I worked with React and the first time I connected frontend and backend.
Within the application, I integrated a data retrieval functionality from a well-known API called RestCountries, allowing users to access detailed information about each country.
Additionally, I created an intuitive user experience, providing users with the ability to filter countries in alphabetical order, both ascending and descending, to facilitate navigation through the extensive list of countries.
Another essential feature is the ability for users to search for countries by name, providing a search field that enables quick retrieval of information about desired countries.
Furthermore, users have the option to mark certain countries as "favorites," allowing them to be saved in a JSON file on the backend. This ensures that user preferences are retained even after closing and reopening the application.
